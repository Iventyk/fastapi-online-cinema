# FastAPI Online Cinema

This is the backend API for the FastAPI Online Cinema project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and run the project.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iventyk/fastapi-online-cinema.git
cd fastapi-online-cinema
```

### 2. Install dependencies with Poetry

Make sure you have Poetry installed.

```poetry install```

This will create a virtual environment automatically and install all required dependencies.

### 3. Run the FastAPI server

The server will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default.
Use --reload to enable auto-reload on code changes.
